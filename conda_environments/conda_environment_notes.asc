= Using miniconda to get LSDMappingTools working

== Before you do anything

Below you will be asked to edit your `.bashrc` file. 
Before you do anything make a copy of this file. 
Then, when you edit it, make sure you use a linux editor. Editors in windows tend to add stupid line endings that mess up your files. 
I use `vim`. This takes a little bit of getting used to so use the internet tutorials to foigure out how it works before you edit anything with it!!

== Attempting to get miniconda working on LSDTopoData

Go into LSDTopoData

[source,console]
----
$ cd miniconda
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
----

Now in the command prompt, it will ask for a location of miniconda 3. Use the location in LSDTopoData:
`/exports/csce/datastore/geos/groups/LSDTopoData/miniconda/miniconda3`

You need to update your path in your .bashrc file. 
Include this line 
`export PATH="/exports/csce/datastore/geos/groups/LSDTopoData/miniconda/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"`

Now we create a new environment. 

[source,console]
----
conda create -n LSDMT python=3.6.7
----

== Attempting to get miniconda working on a machine without access to LSDTopoData (i.e. MSc and BSc students)

Go into your directory that has the most space. Usually this is your datastore directory. 

Make a directory for miniconda, then download miniconda into it:

[source,console]
----
$ mkdir miniconda
$ cd miniconda
----

Figure out where you are:
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
----

Copy the resulting path

Now get miniconda:
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
----


Now in the command prompt, it will ask for a location of miniconda 3. Use the location that `pwd` just gave you (a few steps earlier)

You need to update your path in your .bashrc file. 
Include this line 
`export PATH="/your/path/to/miniconda/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"`

IMPORTANT: you need to change the path so it reflects your directories!!! But you do need to include the /bin part of the above path. 

Then you can create the environment from an environment file:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file


[source,console]
----
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
---

This will take ages. When it is finished you can activate it with

[source,console]
----
conda activate LSDMT2
----
