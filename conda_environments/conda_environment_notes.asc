= Using miniconda to get LSDMappingTools working on Edinburgh servers

== Before you do anything

Below you will be asked to edit your `.bashrc` file. 
Your `.bashrc` file is in your home directory. You can always get to your home directory with:

[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
----

Once you are there, make a copy of this file:

[source,console]
----
$ cp .bashrc old.bashrc
----

Now you can edit the `.bashrc` file using `vim` or `emacs`. I like `vim` but you should read a tutorial before you start it because it is not intuative!
To open the file with `vim` use:

[source,console]
----
$ vim .bashrc
----

You can also edit this file with a text editor. It is *essential* that the file is in Unix format. See this https://kb.iu.edu/d/acux[tutorial for more information].

== If you have access to LSDTopoData

.How do I get access?
***************************
For various IT reasons, undergraduates and taught master's students (that is, any master's degree except master's by research) do not have access to the group datastores. I am sure there is a good IT reason why this is the case, and getting the policy changed would either be extremely time consuming or impossible. If you are in this category skip to the section about not having access. 

If you are a PhD student, staff or visiting researcher, then email Simon to get access. 
***************************

Okay, if you have access to *LSDTopoData*, do the following:

1. You need to update your path in your .bashrc file. To do that, include this line: 
`export PATH="/exports/csce/datastore/geos/groups/LSDTopoData/miniconda/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"`
2. Go onto one of our servers. 
3. Type `source activate LSDMT3`
4. You are finished, but to use *LSDMappingTools*, you need to get them. Use git to clone the repository
+
[source, console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools.git
----
+
5. To run the mapping scripts you need to go into the `LSDMappingTools` directory and run them while in the *LSDMT3* environment. 

=== Notes for Simon

These are notes for Simon that he uses to remember what he did. If you are not Simon you can ignore. 


. First I needed to get Miniconda in LSDTopoData:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd miniconda
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
----
+
. In the command prompt, it asked for a location of miniconda 3. Use the location in LSDTopoData:
`/exports/csce/datastore/geos/groups/LSDTopoData/miniconda/miniconda3`
+
. I created a new environment. 
+
[source,console]
----
conda create -n LSDMT3 python=3.6.7
----
+
. I then spent ages trying to get it to work because python GDAL is evil. 
. Finally, when it worked, I exported the conda environment: `conda env export > environment.yml`

==== Exporting from Docker  

If you have a functioning docker environment, you can export the environment with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ conda list --explicit > Conda_explicit_list.txt
----
+
This file can be used to create an environment with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ conda create --name <env> --file <this file>
----



== Getting miniconda and an environment working on a machine without access to LSDTopoData (i.e. MSc and BSc students)

. Go into your directory that has the most space. Usually this is your datastore directory. 
+
. Make a directory for miniconda, then download miniconda into it:
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir miniconda
$ cd miniconda
----
+
. Figure out where you are:
+
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
----
+
. Copy the resulting path. You will use this in a second.
+
. Now get miniconda:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
----
+
. Now in the command prompt, it will ask for a location of miniconda 3. Use the location that `pwd` just gave you (a few steps earlier)
+
. You need to update your path in your .bashrc file. 
Include this line `export PATH="/your/path/to/miniconda/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"`
+
. IMPORTANT: you need to change the path so it reflects your directories!!! But you do need to include the `/bin` part of the above path. 
+
. Then you can create the environment from an environment file. The one you want is the `conda_list_July2019.txt` in this directory.
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file
+
. You can do this with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools/master/conda_environments/LSDMT_version_0.2.2.txt
$ conda create --name LSDMT3 --file LSDMT_version_0.2.2.txt
----
+
. This will take ages. When it is finished you can activate it with
+
[source,console]
----
conda activate LSDMT3
----
+
. Type `source activate LSDMT3`
. You are finished, but to use *LSDMappingTools*, you need to get them. Use git to clone the repository
+
[source, console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools.git
----
+
. To run the mapping scripts you need to go into the `LSDMappingTools` directory and run them while in the *LSDMT3* environment.
